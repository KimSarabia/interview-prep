/*
Linear Complexity O(n)
Same complexity class
Bigger input means longer runtime in a linear fashion
Steps in your algorithm
Big inputs
*/

/*
Logarithmic Complexity O(log(n))
Can we change complexity?
Yes, but we have to make assumptions
For every step of the algorithm, bisect the string in half, divide it in half
We are dividing the work in half by each step, and double the size of the input and add a step
